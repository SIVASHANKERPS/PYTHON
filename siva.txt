Passionate about a) research in biochemistry, molecular biology, and genomics; b) democratizing high-quality education on society's most impactful sociopolitical and scientific topics; and c) representing marginalized communities in all my areas of interest.

I am currently pursuing an Honours BSc in Biochemistry, and a laboratory assistant at an eco-evo-devo biology lab under Dr. Rajendhran Rajakumar (PI) at the University of Ottawa. Outside academia, I am a member of the Capital Pride Youth Committee (CPYC) to help connect BIPOC queer youth in Ottawa.

Some highlights of my past experience relating to my passions: speaking at IBM Canada about genetically modified biofuels; speaking at SXSW 2020 about using technology for social good; formerly being a lab assistant at Dr. Howard Rundle's (PI) evolutionary biology lab; my work with The Knowledge Society (TKS) as an Innovator, Mentor, and Alum; working as the Publicity Director for the non-profit Operation Med School (OMS) to connect the health care and medical field with youth across Ottawa; contributions to youth performing arts in Ottawa; and writing about topics ranging from social commentary to disruptive technology.

Hi! I'm Amelia Settembre, a young woman currently looking into studying aviation and aerospace engineering - an aspiring pilot, if you will. I write in my spare time. 

I greatly enjoy space technology and discussing philosophical implications behind disruptive technologies, and if you'd like to engage me in discussion about that or chat about aviation more generally, please DM me!
